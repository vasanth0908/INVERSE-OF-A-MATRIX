# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step1 :
We have to initialise program using import numpy to perform mathematical calculation

Step 2:
The input from the user is stored in the variable a

Step 3:
using the np.linalg.inv(A).We can find the inverse of the matrix.

Step 4:
End of the program

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: vasanth s
#RegisterNumber: 212222110052
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[6,2,3],[3,1,1],[10,3,4]])
result = np.linalg.inv(A)
print(result)
```
